 Stored Procedures and Functions
 A Stored Procedure is a precompiled block of SQL statements stored in the database.
It is used to perform one or more operations, such as insert, update, delete, or complex logic.


What is a Function?

A Function is similar to a procedure but always returns a value.
Functions are often used in SELECT statements or expressions.
